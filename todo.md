# TODO

## Core Graph

- [x] Port type validation — reject connections between incompatible data types (e.g. `audio` → `float`)
- [x] Connection error feedback — status bar error toast on incompatible drop
- [x] Node snap to 20 px grid
- [x] Undo / redo — 100-step history stack
- [x] Autosave — serialize graph to `localStorage` every 10 seconds
- [x] Save / load — export graph as JSON, import from file (MenuBar ↓ Save / ↑ Load, also Ctrl+S)
- [x] Node search — filter sidebar by typing
- [x] Right-click context menu on canvas — "Add node", "Paste", "Select all"
- [x] Right-click context menu on node — Duplicate, Delete, Disconnect All

## LED Preview

- [x] Evaluate the actual node graph at runtime instead of the placeholder animation loop
- [x] WebGL shader pipeline (60 fps, per-LED disc + 5×5 glow, Canvas 2D fallback)
- [x] Resize preview — reads width × height from MatrixOutput node (up to 64 × 64)
- [ ] 3D rotate mode — drag to orbit the matrix (requires Three.js or custom WebGL camera)

## Audio

- [x] Wire Web Audio API `AnalyserNode` for real microphone FFT
- [x] Connect FFT output to `FFTAnalyzer` node outputs (bass / mids / treble float values)
- [x] Beat detection — 30-frame rolling average with 300 ms cooldown
- [x] Audio visualizer bar display in the preview panel (16 bars, cyan → magenta)

## Upload Pipeline

- [x] C++ code generator — topological walk of node graph emitting FastLED `.ino`
- [x] Upload panel modal — live code preview, graph validation, board selector
- [x] WebSerial connect / disconnect at 115200 baud
- [x] `.ino` download button
- [ ] Actual WebSerial flashing — send compiled binary to board bootloader
- [ ] In-browser compilation via Web Worker / WASM toolchain (or cloud compile endpoint)

## Nodes

- [x] Math: Add, Multiply, Clamp, MapRange, Sin, Cos, Lerp, Abs, Mod, Min, Max, Random, Counter, Gate, Not, Compare
- [x] Color: HSV→RGB, CHSV (0–255 scale), BlendColors, PaletteSelector, PaletteBlend, BeatSin, XYMapper
- [x] Pattern: SolidColor, NoiseField, Plasma, Fire, Fire2012, SpectrumBars, Noise2D, Simplex2D, Noise3D, RadialBurst, Spiral, Kaleidoscope, Particles, Invert, GradientFrame, GradientSampler, PaletteSampler, Blur2D, LayerBlend
- [x] Audio-reactive: BassPulse, MidrangeWaves, TrebleSparks, BeatFlash, AudioHue
- [x] Compositing / transition: BlendFrames, BrightnessMod, HueShift, Crossfade, Wipe, Dissolve
- [x] Multi-Pattern Master — 4-slot queue, cycle/beat modes
- [x] Custom Formula — inline JS expression with x/y/t/W/H/a/b vars
- [ ] Proper `PaletteSelector` type system — propagate palette name through port connections rather than encoding as a float

## Polish

- [x] Node creation fade-in + scale animation (200 ms)
- [x] Connection spark effect at port on successful link (150 ms)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts — Ctrl+Z undo, Ctrl+Y redo, Ctrl+S save, Delete selected node
- [x] MiniMap with per-category node and edge colors
- [x] Inspector: color picker for color-type properties
- [x] Solarized Dark and Studio Light themes (cycle via MenuBar ☾/✦/☀)
- [x] Reduced-motion toggle and high-contrast mode (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Test suite — no tests exist yet
- [ ] PWA / offline support (service worker + manifest)
